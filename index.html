    <p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Mario Alfaro-Hernandez, Chaz Cooper, Dechen Chuteng, Desmond DesBoine, Hailey
        Gonzales, Tia Yang </p>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> Gary Nguyen, Lisa's Nails</p>
    <p><strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Yang</p>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Lisa and Gary Nguyen are the client's names.They own a nail salon called Lisa's
        Nails. They've been wanting to modernize the business. We plan to solve their problem by creating a website for
        Lisa's Nails. The website

        You may introduce some background information about your project, including client's name, their business, and
        the problem to be solved.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Scope:</strong> The scope is the business area affected by the installation of the product. The website
        will give the business a more online presence. Client experience will be affected since the end users will be
        able to make appointments online and see the business's services easier. Worker schedules will now be
        digitalized along with client information. We've address the owner's want to digitalize their record keeping by
        installing a database. Our project goals are to make a full-stack website that will enable end users to make
        appointments and save their information in an account. Workers will be able to have their availability shown on
        the site. Overall, our goal is to develop and deliver a software system to the benefit of the Product Owner and
        user community.</p>

    <p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Give a high-level overview of the proposed solution.</p>
    <p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Our project is special because it's to help a local business keep up with today's
        online-focused business format. Local business are more easily discovered if they have a website, and will be
        visited more often if people know the services offered. Our design is innovative because we are allowing the end
        users to schedule their service-specific appointments while choosing their favorite technician, if they have
        one. We also plan to allow workers to reschedule, delete, or change booked appointments and update their
        availability. We've been told that this may be hard to implement, but if we succeed, it's what will make our
        project special and innovative. </p>

        and/or video demo, etc.</p>
