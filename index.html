    <p><strong>Team Name:</strong> Anti Coder x2 Club</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Team Members:</strong> Mario Alfaro-Hernandez, Chaz Cooper, Dechen
      Chuteng, Desmond DesBoine, Hailey Gonzales, Tia Yang
    </p>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> Gary Nguyen, Lisa's Nails</p>
    <p><strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Yang</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Background:</strong> Lisa and Gary Nguyen are the client's names.
      They own a nail salon called Lisa's Nails. They've been wanting to
      modernize the business. We plan to solve their problem by creating a
      website for Lisa's Nails. The website will include information about their
      business, their services as well as an appointment booking system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Scope:</strong> The scope is the business area affected by the
      installation of the product. The website will give the business a more
      online presence. Client experience will be affected since the end users
      will be able to make appointments online and see the business's services
      easier. Worker schedules will now be digitalized along with client
      information. We've address the owner's want to digitalize their record
      keeping by installing a database. Our project goals are to make a
      full-stack website that will enable end users to make appointments and
      save their information in an account. Workers will be able to have their
      availability shown on the site. Overall, our goal is to develop and
      deliver a software system to the benefit of the Product Owner and user
      community.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Our proposed solution was to first
      address the problem of paperwork and move everything electronically, with
      this in mind we decided a database would address this problem perfectly.
      Next we wanted to allow easier access for consumers, so combining these
      concepts a website was the best option to cover all bases. The website
      would allow customers to see what our client has to offer while keeping a
      simple database for our client to use.This allows for appointments to be
      scheduled through the website and provide our client and their customers
      with notifcations of each appointment being made. As well as, allowing
      staff to easily set up their schedule for upcoming weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Highlights:</strong> Our project is special because it's to help a
      local business keep up with today's online-focused business format. Local
      business are more easily discovered if they have a website, and will be
      visited more often if people know the services offered. Our design is
      innovative because we are allowing the end users to schedule their
      service-specific appointments while choosing their favorite technician, if
      they have one. We also plan to allow workers to reschedule, delete, or
      change booked appointments and update their availability. We've been told
      that this may be hard to implement, but if we succeed, it's what will make
      our project special and innovative.

      <strong>Prototypes:</strong> We utilized Adobe XD tool to produce a
      clickable high fidelity prototype.

          website in mind, this also allowed for them to tell us in more detail
          what they liked or didnt like and would want to add or remove to a
